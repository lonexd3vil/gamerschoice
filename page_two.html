					WWE 2K17 has brought back the back stage fights plus it also features fights in the crowd. In the previous installment i.e. WWE 2K16, many people complain about the controls that they are quite difficult to master. So the developers have simplified the control for this installment. The developers have emphasized greatly on the career mode where you need to fight with different wrestlers in NXT. Which is the minor league of WWE and then advance to the main round.
