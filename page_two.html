					WWE 2K17 has brought back the back stage fights plus it also features fights in the crowd. In the previous installment i.e. WWE 2K16, many people complain about the controls that they are quite difficult to master. So the developers have simplified the control for this installment. The developers have emphasized greatly on the career mode where you need to fight with different wrestlers in NXT. Which is the minor league of WWE and then advance to the main round.

					The new Ball Physics System elevates gameplay in FIFA 20 to a new level of realism. Offering new shot trajectories, more realistic tackle interactions and physics-driven behaviour. It includes several options to play in three versus three, four versus four and five versus five matches. As well as with professional futsal rules. Gameplay changes to FIFA 20 focus primarily on a new feature titled VOLTA Football. The mode, which translates to ‘return’ in Portuguese, focuses on street football rather. Than the traditional matches associated with the FIFA series.</p>
