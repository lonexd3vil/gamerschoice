	</div>
	<div>
		<p class="start_overview">A Great Game To Play With Friends And Have Fun. It Is An Action And Adventure Game. Rockstar North Was The Developer Of This Game. The Publisher Of This Game Was Rockstar Games. 14 April 2015 Was The Release Date For This Game. The Grand Theft Auto Game Series Was Always Rather Successful. It Was Always Different From Most Games Out There. It Had And Still Has Its Own Place. You Can’t Really Compare GTA With Other Games. There Are Many Similar Games Out There Like Saints Row For Instance. But None Can Really Win A Competition Of Some Kind Against This Game. There Are Great Updates Which Bring Many New Features Into The Game. So GTA V Expands More And More. Game Sounds Along With Graphics Are So Good.<br>
		<br>
		The Open World In This GTA 5 Download PC Game Was Great. Rock Star Itself Has Many Things To Do Also And Sometimes Great Problems With Their Servers. Which Makes It Seem Like They Don’t Pay Attention To What’s Going On. Or That They Don’t Have The Staff To Handle What They Plan To Do. Whatever It Truly Is. The Graphics Of The Game Are Surely Amazing. If You Have A PC That Can Run It On Those Graphics. Otherwise You Will End Up With Some Graphics That Look Like They Were Make 2013. Which Maybe Isn’t That Untrue In This Case. The Game Has So Much You Can Do. Even Though It Sometimes Seems Like That Rock Star Put Their Detail On The Wrong Places. You Have To Show Your Skills As Long As Possible In This Game.</p>

		<p class="gameplay_persp_content">The First-person Mode In GTA V Is Absolutely Stunning. It Looks So Real That You Sometimes Get Scare About That. It Gives You A Great Experience How It Is Like To Drive Around 300 Km/h With A Bike. Then Crash And Fly Around 500m. But Let’s Be Honest If A Game Is Too Realistic It Wouldn’t Be That Fun Anymore For Most. Well The Shooting Is Really Fun Even Though A Bit Hard With Controller. The Police In The Game Is Probably The Most Good Part Of GTA V. You Have Self-radio, Easy To Use And Even Better In This Game. The History And Brands In The Game Are Brilliant. The Single-player Story Follows Three Criminals And Their Efforts. Commit Heists While Under Pressure From A Government Agency. Open World Design Lets Players Freely Roam San Andreas’ Open Country Side.</p>
