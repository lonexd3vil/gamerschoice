		<p class="content_in">Watch Dogs is an open-world game in the city of Chicago, USA. It starts as Aiden Pearce, the main protagonist, and his associate, Damien Brenks, hack into the Merlaut Hotel. However, the job doesn’t go according to plan and someone orders a hit on Aiden. His car gets shot at while he is driving with his niece and nephew sitting. In the back seat, resulting in his young niece’s death. The game takes place one year after those events, as Aiden searches for the people responsible for his loss.<br>
		<br>
		The game is also full of side missions such as fixer contracts, convoys, human trafficking investigations, privacy invasions, etc. Successfully completing these missions will grant players skill points to spend on their hacking skills, shooting skills or driving skills. As the game progresses, unlocking those skills can help a lot to escape the cops. Or give the player more options on how to 	handle certain missions.</p>
